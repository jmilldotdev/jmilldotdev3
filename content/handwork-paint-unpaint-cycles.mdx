I do think Americans are desperate to do meaningful work with their hands. I think this because there are enormous ecologies of furniture restoration influencers, half of whom paint wooden furniture and the other half of whom strip the paint off.

This seems like what you get in a sufficiently wealthy society where people really want to work with their hands, and I don't mind it, though I have accumulated an enormous playlist of videos that could all be of the same dresser going through sixteen or so paint-unpaint cycles.
