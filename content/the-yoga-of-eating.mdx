### Give food your full attention
- Before all meals, observe a brief moment of silence
- Let the first bite of every meal you take be with perfect attentiveness
- Slow down while chewing and swallowing
- Every day, take one meal in silence, with no distractions of any kind.

Some foods are consumed only for the body feeling they provide - good and bad.

You may have chosen foods in the past to deal with the grief and trauma of life. Your body has received what you have given it, and gotten you this far using it. <Link href="/c/your-body-loves-you" className="text-[var(--color-primary)] hover:underline hover:text-[var(--color-secondary)] transition-colors font-medium">your body loves you</Link>.
