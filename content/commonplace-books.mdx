> One of the clearest predecessors to the modern practice of knowledge management are _‚Äúcommonplace books‚Äù_ ‚Äì **centralized, personally curated, and continuously maintained collections of information from various sources that rose to popularity during the Enlightenment and Industrial Revolution in Europe.** These books helped educated people cope with the ‚Äúinformation explosion‚Äù unleashed by the printing press and industrialization. They were highly idiosyncratic, personalized texts used to make sense of a new world of intercontinental trade, long-distance communication, and mass media.¬†**Commonplace books could contain recipes, quotes, letters, poems, tables of weights and measures, proverbs, prayers, legal formulas, notes from sermons, and remedies for common maladies, among many other things.** Commonplacers would transcribe interesting or inspirational passages from their reading, assembling a personalized encyclopedia of quotations, ideas, anecdotes, observations and other information they came across. **The purpose of the book could range from personal recollection and reflection, to source material for writing, speaking, politics, or business. **

Commonplace books as physical artifacts, and how our digital notes will be left behind locked away behind passwords on hard drives.
