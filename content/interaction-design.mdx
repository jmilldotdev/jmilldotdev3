> "In Transferable mechanics, Mary Rose notes that good interaction design often lets users apply knowledge about mechanics they learned before to interact with something, to then interact with something new. This lets them gain new capabilities without understanding new mechanics or abstractions. It helps new users learn to use tools or play games much faster, and makes the process more enjoyable."
