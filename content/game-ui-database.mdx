The Game UI Database was created by [Edd Coates](http://www.twitter.com/EddCoates) as a free resource for UI/UX Designers in the games industry. It was built to aid in the discovery of new inspiration, and to provide a fast and efficient way of searching for reference materials.

All contributions go towards server maintenance, and help ensure that the site will be updated for many years to come!
