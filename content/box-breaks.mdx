### Definition
> "A box break is an event in which a box or case of cards is divided up among collectors who purchase the right to receive cards as part of a random drawing. It’s similar to a raffle except that each participant is guaranteed to receive a certain number of cards.
> 
> These events are typically streamed live (or replayed on YouTube later) so participants can enjoy the excitement of seeing cards get “pulled” as the box is broken. The events are promoted as providing an opportunity for baseball card and sports memorabilia fanatics to obtain valuable cards at an affordable price."
