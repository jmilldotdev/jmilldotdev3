import Link from "next/link";

People experience approximately twice as much pain from loss as they derive pleasure from gain.

### <Link href="/c/expected-value" className="text-[var(--color-primary)] hover:underline hover:text-[var(--color-secondary)] transition-colors font-medium">Expected Value</Link> Example
> Would you rather:
> Get $3,000 guaranteed? (EV: $3k)
> Have an 80% chance of getting $4,000, but a 20% chance of getting $0? (EV: $3.2k)

Most people choose A

> Would you rather:
> Lose $3,000 guaranteed? (EV: -$3k)
> Have an 80% chance of losing $4,000, but a 20% chance of losing $0? (EV: -$3.2k)

Most people choose B.
