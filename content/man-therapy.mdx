> **Man Therapy** is an interactive mental health campaign targeting working age men (25-54) that employs humor to cut through stigma and tackle issues like depression, divorce and anxiety. The campaign features the fictional Dr. Rich Mahogany, described by Adam Newman in the New York Times as "an affable, mustachioed, middle-aged man whose personality might be described as Dr. Phil meets Ron Burgundy, Will Ferrell’s fictional anchorman."Man Therapy was created by Cactus (cactusinc.com), a Denver-based ad agency, in partnership with the Office of Suicide Prevention at the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment. Man Therapy is currently operated by Grit Digital Health (gritdigitalhealth.com)
