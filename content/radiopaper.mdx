About Radiopaper
Radiopaper is a platform for interesting conversations. On Radiopaper, your attention is valued and respected. We don’t use algorithmic feeds to maximize engagement, and we don’t make money from ads.

How it works, briefly
You’ve seen social platforms before. What makes Radiopaper different? What makes it better?

High Quality Conversation
Radiopaper has developed a new system for posts and replies that dramatically improves conversation quality. You can make a new post on Radiopaper whenever you want. When someone replies to one of your posts, it starts out as a private message between you and them. You get to decide whether to publish that reply — that is, allow everyone else to see it — or ignore it. If you ignore the reply, no one else will ever see it. (There are a few important exceptions to this rule: read below for a more detailed explanation.)

So, if someone is rude or insulting to you, you can make sure their reply never sees the light of day. You and your friends on the site can enforce a standard of conversation that you’re all comfortable with.

(While this system deflects the vast majority of trolls and spam, note that it is not the only line of defense. Radiopaper will also take down posts and ban users under certain conditions. You can look at our 
 for more about that.)

Commissioning Posts
Radiopaper lets you pay other users for their writing. To do this, you can find someone whose writing you’d want to pay for. Maybe it’s a journalist, or an author, or an acquaintance with a really good idea. You can pay $20 or more (up to $10,000) to attach a commission for that user to one of your posts, and they’ll be paid once they’ve replied. Radiopaper will collect 10% of these commissions so that we can run the site ad-free. All of our transactions are handled securely by .
