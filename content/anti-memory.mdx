**Anti-memory** is _something related to the current context which you are **unlikely to remember yourself**_

<Link href="/c/knowledge-activations" className="text-[var(--color-primary)] hover:underline hover:text-[var(--color-secondary)] transition-colors font-medium">Knowledge Activations</Link> can be used as antimemory, by keeping metadata on how recently sometthing was created or retrieved. The combination of _close in semantic space to current context_ + _not recently created or retrieved_ can expose your antimemory on a topic
