**Anti-memory** is _something related to the current context which you are **unlikely to remember yourself**_

[[Knowledge Activations]] can be used as antimemory, by keeping metadata on how recently sometthing was created or retrieved. The combination of _close in semantic space to current context_ + _not recently created or retrieved_ can expose your antimemory on a topic
