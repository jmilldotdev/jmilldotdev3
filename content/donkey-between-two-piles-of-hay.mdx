Interlocking opposed beliefs which ultimately cause inactions. Protects the ego and keeps it safe.

-  "i have to change" vs. "i can't change" ⇒ no action
-   "I have extremely high standards, do my best, give it my all" vs. "i don't have time, i don't have the knowledge, i don't have the tools" ⇒ no action
-   "no one will help me" vs. "i need help to move forward" ⇒ no action
