AI-driven text games are as old as language models that can string sentences together. You can just ask a chat model to lead you through a story. The addition of text-to-image models allowed these scenarios to be illustrated. What these experiences lack, however, is the ability to interact with the imagery and hard checks on your actions. They are fundamentally a textual conversation where, more or less, anything goes.

What would it take to replicate the old point-and-click adventure games (or a hidden object game)? Are the model capabilities there yet? To explore this, we created a browser game prototype that creates a scene with objects in response to prompts from the player and makes a short escape room puzzle out of it. The items are clickable and the scene responds to item interactions.

In this post, weâ€™ll give an overview of the experience then dive into how we combined ML models and strategies to realize it.
