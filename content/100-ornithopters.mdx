A perfectly normal Cube with one twist: the only creatures are 100 copies of the card [Ornithopter](https://cubecobra.com/tool/card/Ornithopter). There are no creature tokens, there are no creature lands, and there are no ways to deal damage to your opponent that don't have something to do with the card [Ornithopter](https://cubecobra.com/tool/card/Ornithopter). Inspired by [a tweet](https://cubecobra.com/leave?url=https%3A%2F%2Fx.com%2Frmorganslade%2Fstatus%2F1716838441856782515%3Fs%3D20) and subject of a [Rhystic Studies video](https://cubecobra.com/leave?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DPddm1gbBuWE).
