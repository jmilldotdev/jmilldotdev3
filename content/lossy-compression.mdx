> In information technology, **Lossy compression** or irreversible compression is the class of data encoding methods that uses inexact approximations and partial data discarding to represent the content. These techniques are used to reduce data size for storing, handling, and transmitting content. The amount of data reduction possible using lossy compression is much higher than using lossless techniques.
