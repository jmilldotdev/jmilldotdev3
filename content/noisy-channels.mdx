A noisy channel is a channel which has some _channel capacity_ which obscures the information sent through the channel. It is used in Encoder-Decoder models where a message is encoded through a channel using some function and decoded on the other end using a complementary function

The noisy channel has applications in Social Internet MOC. All messages are pure at one point, and _become distorted, purposely and non-purposely in the transmission process_.

Purposeful distortion is tuning writing to deployment environment. It is tuning output to match a known distribution channel, and matching the known qualities of that channel's noise.

Non-purposeful distortion is like The Telephone Game. It's meaning getting lost within layers of interpretation, and people using a message for their own ends.

The noisy channel is the painter who, no matter how good they are, can never perfectly recreate what they see in the mind's eye.

### Wiki
> The Shannon theorem states that given a noisy channel with channel capacity C and information transmitted at a rate R, then if R lt C there exist codes that allow the probability of error at the receiver to be made arbitrarily small. This means that, theoretically, it is possible to transmit information nearly without error at any rate below a limiting rate, C.
