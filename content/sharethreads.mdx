> Sometimes on /mu/, people create sharethreads, where people upload albums to direct download sites (such as Mediafire or Zippyshare) and then share them with other people on /mu/. Sharethreads tend to be based around a particular theme (a genre normally) or are sometimes just general sharethreads.

How i used to find a lot of my music back in the day. Probably the closest thing we had to virtual record store bins. The tactile experience was somewhat captured in that you would read a user description and see genre + album cover to make your decisions on what to check out. Users were selling the music to you like the records themselves used to have to before algorithms.
