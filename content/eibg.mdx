A card game for deep connection. A therapy session trojan horsed in as a party game.

Master the six emotional archetypes: Enhancer, Connector, Intuitor, Specialist, Conjurer, and Transmuter. Dive through three levels of questions and games unlike any you've experienced before.

A game designed in collaboration with my wife Lucy. The 120 games, rituals, and activities in EIBG are collected from our experience travelling the world and living in various communities full of socially-curious nerds.

Available for purchase someday?
