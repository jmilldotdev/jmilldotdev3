> Affiliate refunding is a process where by you buy something with an affiliate link, refund the item and then keep commision. This works best with digital items but have not many sites that it’s doable on.

> That’s why there’s bots for it. There’s semi automatic bots managed by moderators that let you do it, even tho they usually take a cut of your earnings, like the bot I use takes a huge cut of my earnings even after I pay for the bot. But I don’t complain because I make ~50% of my buying budget(the term used to refer to initial balance used to refund items) in a month. Which is still a shitton of money for me. This means with around 1k its 500$ a month.

> The only problem with the method is bot are very very hard to find, because they try so hard to make it private, I only know 3 bots and they are all probate including the one I use which only sold 1,000 slots. And at 60$ a month (which is a lot of money for the owners if you think about it) and the other bot is kinda decent as well but I can’t remember the link, then the 3rd bot is utter shut so no one uses it.
