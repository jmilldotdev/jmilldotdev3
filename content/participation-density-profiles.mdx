Characteristics of how a user participates in a social network over time.

You can examine time-based characteristics such as:
- Posts per hour of day
- Posts per weekday
- Posts per month, chronologically

These can reveal characteristics about the user like:
- Their location on Earth (time zone)
- Their lifestyle

Then, with a time based component you can start to track things like Interest Drift - how someone's interests change over time.

A drop in posting followed by drastic Interest Drift can signal that the account has been compromised, or is an aged user account repurposed to shill something.

For things like Safemoon and other Scamcoins you can track an account's creation date along the creation date of the project.

Account-Age-to-Karma ratio
Word count/vocabulary diversity over time
