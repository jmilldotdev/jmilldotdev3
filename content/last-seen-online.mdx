You were always a snoop, weren’t you? That’s why you bought an old computer you saw lying among piles of junk at a garage sale. You didn’t even bother to format the computer before you turned it on. You were curious. After all, a personal computer is an extension of another person’s soul, all their secrets, projects, interactions.

“last seen online” is a psychological horror escape room, based on early flash games. Look through someone's computer files. Solve puzzles and discover the secrets that lie within the computer.
