> In computer science, a one-way function is a function that is easy to compute on every input, but hard to invert given the image of a random input.

The idea that so much of the world is possible because of One-Way functions, touching on everything from cryptography to morality. 

Related to the fact that [[attacking is easier than defending]]. It's much harder to build a sandcastle than to stomp it back to a pile of sand. It's easy to drop a glass cup on the floor and have it shatter, it's hard to put it back together. Here [[Kintsukuroi]] could come into play

[[one-way functions and entropy|Entropic One-Way Functions]] are one-way functions whose outcomes are uncertain and cannot be predicted exactly.
