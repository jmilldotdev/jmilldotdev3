> In computer science, a one-way function is a function that is easy to compute on every input, but hard to invert given the image of a random input.

The idea that so much of the world is possible because of One-Way functions, touching on everything from cryptography to morality. 

Related to the fact that <Link href="/c/attacking-is-easier-than-defending" className="text-[var(--color-primary)] hover:underline hover:text-[var(--color-secondary)] transition-colors font-medium">attacking is easier than defending</Link>. It's much harder to build a sandcastle than to stomp it back to a pile of sand. It's easy to drop a glass cup on the floor and have it shatter, it's hard to put it back together.
