### Wikipedia
> Negative space, in art, is the space around and between the subject of an image. Negative space may be most evident when the space around a subject, not the subject itself, forms an interesting or artistically relevant shape, and such space occasionally is used to artistic effect as the "real" subject of an image.

### Personally
Personally, I have never been good with negative space. I remember learning about it but being unable to use it meaningfully in my creative work. 

I think specifically about rapping, and how I did the whole white boy machine gun syllables lyrical miracle cheerios thing.

### Falling Out
I think negative space across most disciplines, but particularly in music is falling out of favor because of:
- Need to grab attention
- Compression and <Link href="/c/the-loudness-war" className="text-[var(--color-primary)] hover:underline hover:text-[var(--color-secondary)] transition-colors font-medium">The Loudness War</Link>
