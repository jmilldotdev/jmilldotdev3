Building on the legendary tradition established by Mat Laibowitz and Elisha Wiesel from 2007–2015, and carried forward as Compass from 2017–2023 under the creative direction of Ben Hoffstein and Colin Teichholtz, Midnight Madness continues its evolution as one of the world’s most spectacular puzzle hunts. This immersive, interactive competition invites teams to test their wit, grit, and teamwork across a series of ingeniously crafted challenges over the course of an epic 12-hour adventure.
