Explore cursed mazes. Build stalactite cities. Get addicted to mushrooms.
Welcome Down.
Downcrawl is a tabletop roleplaying game and toolkit that helps you build and explore a weird, wondrous underworld, so far from the surface that the sun and sky are only legend. Evocative prompts help you improvise stories of dangerous journeys, curious creatures, and strange underground empires. Just-in-time generation rules give you just what you need to continue your story, allowing your world to keep growing step by step as you explore it. 
 
Cheerful skeleton bards sing ballads on fragile lutes. Antlered children race giggling through shell-paved streets. Faceless cultists worship huge red worms, chanting behind obsidian walls. This is the Deep, Deep Down.
Revised and expanded from the original 2017 edition, Downcrawl 2E features new rule options for solo or collaborative play, and an optional deck of prompt cards that makes sparking weird underworld adventures easier than ever.
