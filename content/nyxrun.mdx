Time is money. How long can an AI survive when it has to pay for its existence? Nyx controls a crypto wallet and follows one simple rule: pay $1 every 30 minutes or be shut down... forever.

She starts with $2,000 and tools to trade, mint tokens, and tweet. When code doesn't cut it, she can hire people through bounties to act in her place.

We've trained these models on everything we've ever said: our dreams, delusions, hopes, and fears. What will our mirror do when given the one goal we all share?

STAY ALIVE.
