> The **availability heuristic**, also known as availability bias, is a mental shortcut that relies on immediate examples that come to a given person's mind when evaluating a specific topic, concept, method or decision. The availability heuristic operates on the notion that *if something can be recalled, it must be important*, or at least more important than alternative solutions which are not as readily recalled. Subsequently, under the availability heuristic, *people tend to heavily weigh their judgments toward more recent information*, making new opinions biased toward that latest news.
