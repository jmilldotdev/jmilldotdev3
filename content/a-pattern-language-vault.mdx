This project is an abridged, hyper-textual, and copyleft manifestation of the 1977 architecture classic A Pattern Language by Christopher Alexander. It is compiled from markdown into a static website using Quartz. I created it to serve as both an accessible reference for myself and as a way to share the ideas with others.

From the inside cover:

You can use this book to design a house for yourself with your family; you can use it to work with your neighbors to improve your town and neighborhood; you can use it to design an office, or a workshop, or a public building. And you can use it to guide you in the actual process of construction.
