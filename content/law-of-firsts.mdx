The general concept that among limited edition things, the first in a genre or product tends to be the most valuable.

The first colorway of a new model of shoe tends to sell out and hold value compared to later releases. The first set of a TCG usually the most valuable if not the most powerful. Partially rooted in nostalgia.

The intrinsic version of [[First Mover Advantage]]
