Pu, or the Uncarved Block, represents the natural state of something. Something which is undisturbed. Pu represents an infinite simplicity and infinite complexity. Pu is the fresh snow after a blizzard calms.

To me, this reminds of being at the onset of a paradigm-shifting innovation. Like being there when the printing press was spreading, or when writing or the internet were making their way into peoples' lives. It's the type of innovation that divides time into pre and post. Early actions, directions, events, and standards seem to have disproportionate long-term effect, like the developmental years of a human life.
