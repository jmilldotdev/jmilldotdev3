huh?
Tossing a few up-and-coming CEOs on stage to pitch their Seed round, but it comes with a huge twist! Pitching more than just their real business... they'll pitch a FAKE business idea, too!


Event

Picking a Bad Business Idea
Each CEO presenting will pick a ridiculous business idea. They could get ideas like pigeon messaging or a flat earth cruise line. We won't know until they open up that mystery box!



Event

QUICK! Prep the Pitch Deck
These CEOs will only have 15 minutes to prepare the presentations!


Event

Pitch within 5mins!
They'll need to convince the crowd that this insanely bad business idea could work. Time's ticking with only 5 minutes to pitch the plan!


Event

Have a Laugh!
The audience gets a good laugh while seeing how these CEOs communicate, out from behind their real business, handle adaptability, and more. Can they handle the pressure?!


Event

Back to Business
Jokes aside, these CEOs will then pitch their REAL business. Investors will see a different side to the team and company they might be investing with.


Event

Hustle Time
Open floor networking among entrepreneurs and investors. Make the most of the time and share which bad idea could've worked.
