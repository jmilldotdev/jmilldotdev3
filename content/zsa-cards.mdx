A deck of inspiration and connection.

These Cards are Special

The card’s rank within its suit.

The card’s suit. There are 8 of these.

A visual. For 0-X, these are icons. For face cards and Aces, these were lovingly drawn by our host of featured artists, shown below.

Card Face

A running number. Each card in the deck has an individual number. For 0-9 cards in each suit, the last digit of the card number always matches the rank.

A short title. This only appears on 0-X cards and works well when telling a story.
