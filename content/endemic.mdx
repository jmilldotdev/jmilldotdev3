Maturing Communities

Endemic brings together specialized professionals to help communities plan, develop, and manage critical components of community growth. We offer support throughout the entire process, including assessing the opportunities in the local environment, recruiting community members and leaders, and the ongoing implementation of basic infrastructure and new industries. Our support is guided by our principles for creating more sacred lifestyles and evaluating how choices in one area impact all other areas. When Endemic supports whole community development we begin with a series of assessments that help us and the communities understand their opportunities and constraints. When we support with a narrower aspect of development we tailor the assessment to those goals.
