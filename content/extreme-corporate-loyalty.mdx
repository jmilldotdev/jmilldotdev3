I commit myself to the corporate culture. My team is my family. This is more than a job, it's who I am.

I commit myself to silence. I will not speak a word to the public, or to any employee who is not disclosed.

I commit myself to efficiency. I will track my time and follow the Jira sprint schedule. The SCRUM Master is my master.

I commit myself to vigilance. I will report suspicious activity and watch my team members for signs of disloyalty.

By accepting these commitments, I affirm my allegiance to Del Complex, its standards, protocols, and objectives.
