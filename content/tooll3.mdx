TOOLL3 is an open source software to create realtime motion graphics. We are targeting the sweet spot between real-time rendering, graph-based procedural content generation and linear keyframe animation and editing. This combination allowsâ€¦

- artists to build audio reactive vj content
- use advanced interfaces for exploring parameters
- or to combine keyframe animation with automation

Technical artists can also dive deeper and use tool for advanced development of fragment or compute shaders or to add input from midi controllers and sensors or sources like OSC or Spout.

We hope to bring together a community of artists, developers and creative tinkerers to drive the design and development of the software as a free open source project.
