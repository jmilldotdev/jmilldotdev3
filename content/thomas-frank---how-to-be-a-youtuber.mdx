This site contains a collection of resources that can teach you everything you will ever need to know in order to become a full-time YouTuber.

Included in this guide is a comprehensive gear list that can take you from absolute zero to having a studio, camera, and audio setup that looks and sounds as good as any pro YouTuber (for around $3,500 all-inclusive).

Also included is a list of my favorite digital tools for editing, finding stock footage and music, and more.

There’s also a large database of free videos and articles covering everything related to video production - camera basics, lighting, audio, set design, gear, editing, color grading, animation, and more.
