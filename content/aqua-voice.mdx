Aqua Voice uses a fusion transcription architecture + a client context engine to be the most accurate speech-to-text system available. Text is automatically formatted to fit the specific application and document. This enables using voice for entirely new applications like technical prompting. Aqua produces the highest quality output of any voice to text system.
