This is an independent DIY search engine that focuses on non-commercial content, and attempts to show you sites you perhaps weren't aware of in favor of the sort of sites you probably already knew existed.

The software for this search engine is all custom-built, and all crawling and indexing is done in-house. The project is open source. Feel free to poke about in the [source code](https://git.marginalia.nu/) or contribute to the development!

The search engine is currently serving about 108 queries/minute.
