An app built at the Edge City Lanna Hackathon in 2024. The idea is an app which helps you reprogram your phone use tics and replace it with things like moments of reflection, or giving your friends a call.

- Broadcast to your friends when idle to let them know you are available for conversations.
- Answer to mindfulness prompts and get prophecies with the Great Monolith when broadcasting.
- Your moments of connection are stored as alien plants in your zen garden and on-chain.
