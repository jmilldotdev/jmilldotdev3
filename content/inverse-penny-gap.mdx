The inverse <Link href="/c/penny-gap-problem" className="text-[var(--color-primary)] hover:underline hover:text-[var(--color-secondary)] transition-colors font-medium">Penny-Gap Problem</Link>, where at a market where everything is a low price or on fire sale you scoop as much as you can, but if everything were free then you would be more keen to view it as a gift and only take what you need.

Think this applies to physical goods, and the <Link href="/c/penny-gap-problem" className="text-[var(--color-primary)] hover:underline hover:text-[var(--color-secondary)] transition-colors font-medium">Penny-Gap Problem</Link> applies to intellectual property.
