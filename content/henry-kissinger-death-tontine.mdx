So far: 3861 death dates and $19305 raised.
Okay, so how do I get in on this Death Tontine?
1
Guess Kissinger's Death Day.
2
Donate to an organization that undoes some of the damage of US imperialism:

☞ Cambodian Children's Fund
☞ Desafío Levantemos Chile
☞ East Timor and Indonesia Action Network
☞ Guatemala Forensic Anthropology Project
☞ The Halo Trust
☞ Yemen Relief Project

3
Nab your death date(s) by uploading your receipt. $5 is one death date.
4
On the glorious day that Kissinger eats it, whoever got the date right* wins:

A selection of liquors from countries where Kissinger has overthrown the democratically elected leader. (Or if you don't drink, something else cool.)
