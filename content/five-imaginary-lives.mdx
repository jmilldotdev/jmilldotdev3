I did this again with <Link href="/c/-lucy-qiu" className="text-[var(--color-primary)] hover:underline hover:text-[var(--color-secondary)] transition-colors font-medium">@ Lucy Qiu</Link> and I think it was something like:

- Master craftsman/chef
- Travelling junk dealer pre-internet
- Diver
- AI researcher
- ???

___
-   _Marine Biologist_ - the OG dream, what I would have told you I wanted to be as a kid. I love the water so much, and to explore and make discoveries in some remote wetland would definitely be the story of one of my five perfect lives
-   _Nomad, world traveler, lifestyle design expert_ - To be a Tim Ferris type, a travel blogger who explores the world and runs some kind of purely digital marketing company.
-   _Electronic musician_ - a touring bass musician, making lowend slaps that make wooks move and shake. couch surfs, does drugs, lives day to day but moves like a vet.
-   _Merchant, hustler, treasure hunter_ - someone who knows everything about the prices of everything, and in which direction things will move. Spends time scouring local markets and stores for treasures and flip them for 10-100x markups.
-   _Interior designer_ - someone who is an expert in making places vibe. Unlimited resources to design neon, chlorophyll paradises. Expert in eccentric spaces.
-   _Coffee roaster_ - own a coffee roaster in a Charlottesville-type college down. All the regular hipsters love me.
-   _Salesman_ - selling something theoretical, like insurance or contracts in boardrooms. I hate the suit and the strict rules but love the game and the rush of the win when i get a sale is enormous
-   _Data analyst for political nonprofit_ - Kind of what i was doing with OneVA, just put money aside and use my powers of data analysis for a leftist cause full-time.
-   _Gambler_ - Bothered to learn how to game holdem when I was a kid, moved into grinding casino games like holdem full time when I turned 21. I'm known around the backroom cash games for my soul reads.
-   _Record dealer_ - Maybe would have to be a past life, but would've loved to be one of those guys who sets up booths at travelling record shows, or be a digging assistant for someone like Cut Chemist's round the world digging trips
