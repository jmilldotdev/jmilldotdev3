>Tsundoku (Japanese: 積ん読) is acquiring reading materials but letting them pile up in one's home without reading them. It is also used to refer to books ready for reading later when they are on a bookshelf.
>[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsundoku)

Acquiring content for acquiring content's sake. The thrill of the hunt.

Personally, I remember how back in the day I used to love collecting digital content that I never actually consumed. Anime movies, music plugins, workout programs - all [[Shiny New Thing]]s.
