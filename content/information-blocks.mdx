**Procedure, Process, Concept, Structure, Classification, Principle, Fact**

> **Information blocks replaced paragraphs as the fundamental unit of meaning and presentation.** Unstructured information was ‚Äúclustered‚Äù into information blocks with clear labels, which were linked together and further refined in the writing process. **Horn and his collaborators identified 40 types of information blocks that could be categorized as one of seven types: Procedure Process Concept Structure Classification Principle Fact**. These types were standardized across all kinds of topics and projects. Research by Horn and others indicated that about 80% of virtually any subject matter could be classified using this system. It was found that by chunking a body of information in this way early on in a project, there were tremendous benefits at every subsequent stage.
