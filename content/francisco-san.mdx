 francisco san is a hundred thousand dollar fund to make the city and county of san francisco more whimsical through eventures and installations.

grantees can be for parties, pop-ups, puzzle hunts, art, races, (un)conferences, distribution of interesting objects or anything in between or on a different plane. the only requirement is to have a physical component in the city and county of san francisco.

here are some priors on the kind of project that might be funded, refresh for a new one! there is a list of funded projects that may be more informative though!
