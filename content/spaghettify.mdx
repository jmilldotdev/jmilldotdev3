Inspired by Github Copilot Brushes, Spaghettify asks "What if you could use AI to make your code worse?"

Do things like introduce bugs, obscure code, document with emojis, add random whitespace, and more.

One of our most viral projects, Spaghettify has amassed thousands of downloads and was the #1 post on Hacker News at launch.
