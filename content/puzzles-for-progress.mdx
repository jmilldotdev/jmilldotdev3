ABOUT
Welcome to Puzzles for Progress! This site is home to hundreds of logic and word puzzles, all hand-crafted by me. I tend to post them in "puzzle pages" of three â€” first weekly, later biweekly, now whenever I want. Spanning a wide variety of puzzle types, from crosswords to sudoku to Capsules to Spirals, I like to think there's something for everyone! All puzzles are available in printable pdf versions, and most in mobile-friendly online interfaces as well.
