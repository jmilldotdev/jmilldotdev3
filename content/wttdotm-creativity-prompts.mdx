This is a list of prompts I've collected over the years for inspiration when trying to come up with a project to work on. I've tried to include some relevant work, thought starters, or short comments where relevant, but they are meant to be incomplete and interpreted as broadly as possible. Any question about the prompt would include X or Y can be answered with “yes.” They are there as direction and mild constraint, without either of which there is no creativity.
