> In the first part of Understanding Media, McLuhan also states that different media invite different degrees of participation on the part of a person who chooses to consume a medium. Some media, such as film, were **"hot"** - that is, **they enhance one single sense**, in this case vision, in such a manner that **a person does not need to exert much effort** in filling in the details of a movie image. McLuhan contrasted this with **"cool"** TV, which he claimed **requires more effort on the part of viewer** to determine meaning, and comics, which due to their minimal presentation of visual detail require a high degree of effort to fill in details that the cartoonist may have intended to portray.
