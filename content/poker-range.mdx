A modern concept in Hold'em Poker, where one's actions pin them to a known set of `ranges`, or hands they could be capable of having based on a combination of their pre-flop actions and positi®on in the hand. Pre-flop actions limit players to a range of holdings, and then post flop actions are taken based not only on the cards that are actually in play, but also based on the perceived ranges of all players.

A common play pattern this could result in is taking a pot while holding nothing based on the combination of the board and your opponents' perception of your range.
