WhaleChess is a fully on-chain implementation of chess that also includes custom pieces and play-to-earn mechanics. Players accumulate new pieces as they play, which are generated by having an LLM service interact with our contracts. Players can then build new squads from the pieces in their collection and battle them for glory.

We used Solidity & the MUD framework to build the game contracts.
