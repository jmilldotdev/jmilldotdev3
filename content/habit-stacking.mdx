Batching things you want to do with things you want yourself to do, essentially entwining them

Can be either the _batching of similar things_, like getting all of your oral hygeiene done at once (brush, floss, mouthwash), or making yourself do something new by _bundling it with something existing_, like how i got into writing [[Morning Pages]] by doing them with my coffee every morning.
