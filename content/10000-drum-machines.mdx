Back in 2019, I sketched out designs for a couple of web-based drum machines. I didn't actually code them until 2025 and then thought, ok, that was fun, I should make more.

Why 10,000? I don't know. I was trying to come up with a name for a collection of drum machines and "10,000 DRUM MACHINES" was all that came to mind.

I probably won't ever reach that lofty number (a life expectancy assumption of 75 years only gives me 13,165 days left), but maybe we can get closer if you help!
