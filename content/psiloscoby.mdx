Psilocybin Brewed by Kombucha
We can genetically engineer a kombucha SCOBY (symbiotic culture of bacteria and yeast) to produce psilocybin while it ferments. We can do this by printing genes from magic mushrooms and embedding them into the SCOBY’s DNA. Once we make a single psiloscoby, it can grow and divide and be shared among friends, to brew their own psilobucha.
