 _“Ambient findability”_ is a term coined by information architect [[@ Peter Morville]] in a book of the same name. **It describes the practice of creating environments where relevant information can be found and used, whether that is a library or a smartphone.** When an item is “findable,” it means that it is easy to discover and locate. The key skill in navigating such an environment is wayfinding, which refers to “the series of things people know and do in order to get from one place to another, inside or outside.” It is a skill we developed to navigate physical environments that we’ve since adapted to virtual environments.
